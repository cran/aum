\title{
  Penalized models with non-zero fn at penalty=0
}
\description{
  Usually we assume that fn must be zero at penalty=0, but this is not
  always the case in real data/labels. For example in the PeakSegDisk
  model with penalty=0, there are peaks almost everywhere but if a positive
  label is too small or misplaced with respect to the detected peaks,
  then there can be false negatives.
